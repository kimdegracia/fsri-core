abstract = {Water has become the most widely used fire-fighting agent because its fire suppression performance is hard to beat. The thermal characteristics of water make it ideally suitable as an extinguishing agent for most types of fire, whether it is used to extract heat directly from the flames, the hot products of combustion or from the surface of the fuel. The phase change from liquid water to water vapour (steam) is particularly effective in extracting thermal energy and the production of large quantities of water vapour may further contribute to fire extinguishment by reducing the oxygen concentration of the surrounding atmosphere, particularly where the fire is confined. The present paper is based on an extensive literature review conducted within Edinburgh University's Fire Safety Engineering Group and sponsored by the UK Home Office Fire Research and Development Group. The aim of the research project was to establish the current state-of-the-art regarding the use of water sprays for the suppression and extinguishment of typical (Class ‘A') compartment fires and to identify where gaps exist in the current knowledge.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature This paper concerns the interaction between water sprays and a smoke layer in a corridor, without any interaction with fire activity. Three water sprays are tested, a high-pressure water mist system and two sprinkler systems under different operating pressures. Our study aims to compare the impact of these three sprays on the smoke layer, based on the analysis of temperature and transmittance profiles. Characterization of the smoke layer before spray activation, based on either temperature or transmittance was found to be similar, providing a smoke free layer at around middle height in the corridor. During spray operation, discrepancies were observed in some cases depending on whether the smoke layer was studied based on the temperature or the transmittance profiles. Spray operation may provide gas cooling, resulting in homogeneous temperature profiles, while vertical variations of droplet size and soot or droplet concentration can still induce a variation in transmittance. The impact of water spray on the smoke layer varies with the spray system. For the water mist system and the highest-pressure sprinkler system, the spray operation induces a complete de-stratification with well-mixed steady-state conditions along the corridor as well as strong smoke cooling and visibility alteration. With the lowest-pressure sprinkler system, only a localized alteration of this stratification is observed under the spray, while the environment remains thermally and optically stratified downstream in the corridor despite spray operation. Relationships described in the literature were used to confirm and explain these observations. Ratios were evaluated to compare the drag effect due to the spray and the buoyancy effect related to the fire. All tests provided ratios of drag number over buoyancy number much greater than one. This confirms the ability of these relationships to predict the occurrence of de-stratification. Qualitatively, the highest ratios were found for the high pressure system and for the water mist system, which actually led to the most important de-stratification effects. In contrast, the weaker ratio found for the lower pressure system was still above one, i.e., coherent with a de-stratification which did not affect the whole corridor however.},

abstract = {Residential sprinkler systems (RSS) are one intervention to prevent fire injury and death, yet there is no literature documenting why RSS homeowners opt to purchase a sprinkler-equipped home. This manuscript describes homeowners' decisions to purchase homes with residential sprinkler systems (RSS) and their experiences with the technology. It also compares how RSS homeowners and owners of homes without RSS value sprinklers and their levels of support for policies to mandate RSS in new homes. We used a national online web panel to sample owners of 1- and 2-family homes, and descriptive methods to analyze the resulting data. Our final sample included 1,357 homeowners of 1- and 2-family homes without RSS and 976 homeowners with RSS. RSS homeowners were more likely than owners of non-RSS homes to indicate they would buy an RSS home in the future (75 {\%} vs. 30 {\%}), and more often indicated a willingness to pay for sprinklers (70 {\%} vs. 40 {\%}). RSS homeowners also expressed higher levels of support for policies to mandate RSS in all new 1- and 2-family homes (48 {\%} vs. 19 {\%}). The findings offer insight into educational and policy strategies to promote RSS in all new homes, and provide a foundation for future research in this area.},

abstract = {Three full-scale fire tests were conducted in a commercial manufactured home 4.3 m wide by 18.3 m long with 10 degrees sloped ceilings. The purpose of the tests was to determine the performance of limited water supply (LWS) sprinklers under a sloped ceiling and to determine whether the minimum distance allowed between sprinklers could be reduced from 2.4 m to 1.8 m. Six prototype LWS sprinklers were installed at a spacing of 1.8 m by 2.4 m in the Living room/kitchen area, which measured 4.0 m by 7.2 m. The ceiling and walls were combustible in all three tests, and the room was ventilated by three open windows. The fuel package for all three tests consisted of a vinyl-covered chair with polyurethane padding, double-layered curtains (100{\%} polyester and 50{\%} cotton/50{\%} polyester), and a wooden end table. In the first test, the fuel package was placed in a corner; in the second test, along the wall under the apex of the ceiling between two sprinklers; and in the third test, along the longitudinal wall between two sprinklers. In all tests, no more than two sprinklers actuated. The flow rate with one and two sprinklers operating was 38 l pm and 49 l pm, respectively. Flow after the first sprinkler actuation was maintained for 10 minutes when one sprinkler actuated and for 7 minutes 40 seconds when two sprinklers actuated. The total flow in each of the three tests was 380 l. In all three tests, the sprinklers prevented the curtains and wall paneling from becoming involved in the fire during sprinkler operation. Tenability based on carbon monoxide concentration and gas temperature at the 1.5 m level was maintained in all three tests.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the only parameter used to measure the performance of total compartment (i.e. total flooding) water mist or water spray systems during fire testing has been the time to extinguishment. However, the use of a single parameter has been criticized since it can result in poor system designs. This study evaluates additional parameters in order to improve the characterization of system performance. Two series of fire tests were conducted with a number of water mist and water spray fire protection systems: the former in a 500m(3) test compartment using three different systems; the latter in a 250m(3) compartment using four different systems. The heat release rate of the fire and the gas temperatures inside the test compartment were measured. Based on these measurements, the fire suppression capability of the systems, their temperature reduction capability and their ability to mix water vapor, water droplets and combustion gases within the compartment were determined. The tests revealed that the time to extinguishment varies several tens of percent under identical conditions. It was also observed that the relative performance of the systems was influenced by the size of the fire. The results obtained with the additional parameters were much more repeatable and consistent than using time to extinguishment alone. It is concluded that fairly simple and inexpensive measurements can improve current fire test procedures.},

abstract = {Fire growth and Required Delivered Density measurements were obtained for a vinyl-cov ered reclining chair as part of a program to evaluate the Actual Delivered Density (ADD)/Required Delivered Density (RDD) approach to suppression prediction for quick response sprinklers in a light hazard scenario. In two tests, chemical and convective heat release rates of the burning chair were obtained from a fire products collector, while the radiative heat release rate was measured using a heat flux gauge.The average maximum chemical heat release rate was 1.5 MW (85,000 Btu/min) with the convective fraction being 56{\%}. The average growth time of the fire, assuming a second power growth curve (t2), was 100 s. The RDD of the chair was determined by measuring the effect of water application on the convective heat release rate of the chair. Nominal application densities of 2.4, 3.7, 6.1 and 8.6 mm/min (0.06, 0.09, 0.15, and 0.21 gpm/ft2) were applied over a convective heat release rate range of 100 to 450 kW (5700 to 25,600 Btu/min). The RDD over the range was observed to be between 3.7 and 6.1 mm/min (0.09 and 0.15 gpm/ft 2). Due to variations in fire spread and shielding, the RDD did not vary systematically with heat release rate.},

To illustrate a practical application, some details of the on-going fire protection programme of the Norwegian Stave Churches are provided, while the perspectives of using 'water mist' for suppressing fires in other historic buildings and museums are discussed. Though there are still uncertainties as to the transferability of the technology from one application to another, and there is a need for more experimental and theoretical work, fine water sprays seem to represent an interesting approach for fire protection of historic buildings and as a potential replacement for Halon in museums. {\textcopyright} 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The benefits and costs associated with installation and use of a fire sprinkler system are compared across three prototypical single-family house types: colonial, townhouse, and ranch. Each of the house types varies by design, size, and fire sprinkler affordability. Six fire sprinkler system designs are evaluated: a multipurpose network system, three stand-alone systems, and two stand-alone systems equipped with a backflow preventer. The sprinkler designs vary by installation cost (materials and labor cost) and required annual maintenance, but all were designed to meet the NFPA 13D standard. The estimated benefits of fire sprinklers include reductions in the following: the risk of civilian fatalities and injuries, homeowner insurance premiums, uninsured direct property losses, and uninsured indirect costs. Results show that residential sprinkler systems not requiring expensive annual upkeep or maintenance are economical. The expected PVNB in 2005 dollars is estimated as {\$}2,967 for the colonial-style house, {\$}3,099 for the townhouse, and {\$}4,166 for the ranch-style house, given installation of the lowest life-cycle cost sprinkler system in each of the house types.

Secondly, both gas cooling effect and air entrain- ment in the water spray cone are included. The properties of gas phase related to evaporation are specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity. All these are evaluated by the one-third rule. The Runge–Kutta algorithm is used to solve the ordinary differential equation group for the droplet motion with heat trans- fer. Droplet positions, velocities, temperatures and diameters are calculated while traveling in the hot air reservoir. The effects of air temperature, water vapor mass fraction, thickness of hot air reservoir, and initial diameter on the droplet behavior are analyzed. The quantity of heat absorbed by a single droplet is calculated. Results are then calculated for a water spray by taking it has many droplets. The cooling effect of the water vapor produced is considered. Water spray consisting of small droplets should absorb more heat while acting on the hot air layer. The ratio of the heat for vaporization to the total heat absorbed by water can go up to 0.9 when all the droplets are evaporated. Limited experimental data are selected to verify the mathematical model. Predicted results are useful for studying fire suppression by water mist system.},
